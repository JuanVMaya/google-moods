Google Moods App was a front-end application inspired in the "How might we" increase access to mental health resources so that people can feel supported and improve their wellbeing?

The web development was a done in collaboration with: 
- Chelsia Tong
- Muhammad Choudhary

## ***Technologies***: 
1. React: JS library allowed to quickly add visual components that can be reused throughout the app. It allowed for nice rerendering as our app state changed. 
2. SCSS: Superset of CSS that easily helped break down styling with BEM convetion.
3. Axios: NPM package allowed for easy connection to our Express Server endpoints.
